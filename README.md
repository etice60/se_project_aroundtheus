# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Modal
- Javacript

**Intro**

This project focuses on the Javascript and making the page interactive. Modal box is created and the user can enter in the name and description. We have also styled the page through Javascript in the card elements.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
